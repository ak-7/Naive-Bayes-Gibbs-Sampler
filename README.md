Naive Bayes Gibbs Sampler
=========================

This project implements the Gibbs sampler for Naive Bayes document classification described in [Resnik and Hardisty 2010, "Gibbs Sampling for the Uninitiated"](http://drum.lib.umd.edu/handle/1903/10058).
It closely follows the notation and design put forth in that paper.
The only significant difference is that this code allows the documents to be grouped into more than two classes.

It requires that [Numeric Python](http://numpy.scipy.org/) be installed.
